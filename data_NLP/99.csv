Between 1975 and 1981, the longest trial in German legal history took place in Düsseldorf. Fifteen men and women, former camp guards, were accused of having participated in the murder of thousands. Director Fechner worked eight years to complete this three-part film, which is composed of interviews with defendants, witnesses, judges, prosecutors, defense councils, historians, criminals, and victims. Filming was not permitted during the 474 days of the six-year trial, so Fechner had to reconstruct the trial. The film is a kind of ""counter"" trial and an interpretation of the original proceedings. The accused, who hardly said a word during the original trial, eagerly volunteer in front of the camera. Employing a mosaic-like technique and hard confrontational editing, Fechner allows both criminals and victims to reveal themselves.",14.837,/9M3FWWF4VzCsSLTvt3KyAfAYjNz.jpg,6.3,1984-11-21

Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction.

The prevailing view of the mild-mannered Holyfield was that he was a journeyman – the heavyweight champion, but never a truly great one. Though Holyfield dramatically lost and recaptured the heavyweight crown, and then lost it again, even he understood that his career would ultimately be defined by how he stood up to Tyson – if he ever got his chance.  By the time of their much-hyped and oft-delayed heavyweight title bout in November of 1996, Holyfield was 34 and considered past his prime.  Four years younger, Tyson was heavily favored to be standing over another meek and easily vanquished opponent at the end.  Instead, we got two of the sport’s most memorable fights – but for very different reasons.",3.712,/nyaO2SCLxDeshPMcDuJgOp4CyA9.jpg,6.7,2015-11-10

Loved and hated in equal measure – loved by other critics for whom she was immensely influential, and hated by filmmakers whose films she trashed - Kael destroyed films that have since become classics such as The Sound of Music and raved about others such as Bonnie and Clyde. She was also aware of the perennial difficulties for women working in the movies and in film criticism, and fiercely fought sexism, both in her reviews and in her media appearances.",1.91,/1puqS84P9JxyxH3Cxw0CRhxifIj.jpg,6.6,2019-03-22
